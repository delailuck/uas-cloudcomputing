bb0110,"The switch 2 is pretty much what I wanted out of my switch 1. The changes and refinements aren’t huge, but took what was a good console to a great console. From here it is just waiting for more good 1st party titles to keep coming out!",16
youresilent,Agree!,1
Deceptiveideas,"Highly recommend picking up the AmFilm Glass Screen Protector. You can get the 3 pack for $5 after coupon. This will help prevent future scratches.

Dunno which brand you bought but don’t overpay for a screen protector.",7
drhomelessguy,Where at?,2
Deceptiveideas,"These are the codes for the Amazon products.

3-Pack Tempered Glass Screen Protectors ($4.95 - Apply promotion code IMMYONIC)

2-Pack Tempered Glass Screen Protector (Matte Finish) ($6.49 - Apply promotion code Z5J4OS2X)

2-Pack amFilm Auto-Alignment OneTouch Screen Protector (Matte Finish)  ($7.52 - Apply promotion code RGBRQ8AL)",4
drhomelessguy,Many thanks!,1
Deceptiveideas,"I just double checked and I bought the one for $8. It comes with a tray you place over the switch and press down to get the screen protector aligned perfectly the first time.

The $5 one is your typical screen protector where you need to use your hands to align the protector with the screen.",2
shortandpainful,I bought the 3-pack and it came with an alignment tray. Maybe it was a different listing.,1
Deceptiveideas,"Are you talking about the rectangle plastic panel? That’s not the premium one touch tray. 

The one touch tray is when you literally plop your switch down and just tap to have it be applied for you.

Though if it did come with the one touch tray then you could be right, a different listing.",1
shortandpainful,"No, not the one touch tray, but you also don’t need to align it by hand. Mine was aligned perfectly the first time.",1
Deceptiveideas,"My problem with those panels is sometimes the screen protector will shift while inside the panel, causing them to be slightly off center. Or they pick up dust/bubbles while you’re aligning the protector inside the panel.",2
shortandpainful,"Makes sense, I just wanted to clarify that it does come with an aligner and not just the protectors.",1
bb0110,Does it mute the crispness and colors a little?,0
OisBlue,Not at all and super easy to install,4
Deceptiveideas,"The regular “gloss” one doesn’t seem to affect visuals at all.

The “matte” anti-reflective screen protectors can make colors appear duller, but that’s the trade off you make when switching from glossy to anti-reflective. Some people might argue being able to see in sunlight is much better tradeoff than a minor downgrade in colors.",3
Well_Is_It_Then,Throwing in my 2c to say that Amfilm is amazing. Love that it comes with two in case you mess it up and the tray to help align it is great.,1
Ninja--Vanish,Just unboxed my Switch 2 today and the first thing I did was put on that AmFilm screen protector. I bought the auto alignment one touch version and it went on perfect.,6
NyquillusDillwad20,"Same. Most of the recent reviews on Amazon for it are bad, so I was hesitant. I'm thinking it may just be review bombs from other Chinese companies so they can steal some sales. Mine went on perfectly and it is crystal clear. Touch works perfectly too.",5
Deceptiveideas,"I just checked the reviews because I got curious. Looks like all AmFilm’s screen protectors get lumped together as you can see reviews for the Switch 1 screen protector. 

Reading through the reviews, the switch 1 protectors have a recent manufacturing defect going on where they’re placing the microphone cut upside down. 

There’s also a lot of reviews of people not installing the protector correctly (bubbles) so they left a negative review lol",3
NyquillusDillwad20,"Yeah, I sorted by recent to see the Switch 2 reviews from the past few days. A lot of 1-stars.  Some complaining about bubbles (which is baffling given how easy it is to install), others complaining about dust coming on the screen protectors, and some about scratches on the glass. I had none of those issues.",2

Electronic_Impact,"it's a decent console and i love that there are a lot of good deals already for games. 2,99 for brothers, a game i love is just a must play imo. I bought a couple of second hand switch game that got free upgrades and it runs very well, looks nice but i must admit a different controller for the switch 2 would make it even better. So i bought a 8bit ultimate and it should work after a firmware update.",0
